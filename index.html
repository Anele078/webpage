                Gqeberha previously known as Port Elizabeth, or 'PE' as it is known locally, is a port city and popular holiday destination on South Africa's Eastern Cape Sunshine Coast, famed for its outstanding beaches, watersports, waterfront, animal attractions, and, above all, its friendly people.
                The picture on the left represents one of the famous places to visit in Gqebherha, Donkin Reserve, it is a small park founded in 1820 by Sir Rufane Donkin, the founder of Port Elizabeth. The heartbreaking pyramid-shaped memorial to Sir Donkin's wife, Elizabeth, is a feature of the park, with the words "To the remembrance of one of the most flawless of human beings who has given her name to the town below" etched on it.
                I would like to visit Gqeberha one day to explore some of its beautiful places especially Donkin Reserve.
